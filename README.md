# Speech Recognition

The aim is to implement a Speech Recognition System for isolated word recognition. 

The idea is recognizing the identity of the word someone says in English through the microphone and detecting if this word is one of the system words, and which one is it. This is done by extracting features from the recorded audio using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) technique. Then classify these features using one of two models: Artificial Neural Network (ANN), or Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Finally, we use the detected word to perform specific tasks.



# Project Status

We managed to implement the ASR system and choose two applications for it which are Numbering System which can be easily used in numerous real-life applications such as security and dialing systems controlled by the human voice, and the Directions System which will be useful in objects movement control applications like gaming, and self-driving cars.

We implemented each application using two different neural network models(ANN, CNN) and compared between them in terms of performance and accuracy.

It was very clear that the performance of the CNN model is better than the ANN model for each application.

# Reflection

This was a Graduation Project built during my last college year at Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University, Communication and Electronics section.
