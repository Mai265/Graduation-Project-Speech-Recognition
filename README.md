# Speech Recognition

The aim is to implement a Speech Recognition System for isolated word recognition. 

The idea is recognizing the identity of the word someone says in English through the microphone and detecting if this word is one of the system words, and which one is it. This is done by extracting features from the recorded audio using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) technique. then classifying these features using one of two models: Artificial Neural Network (ANN), or Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Finally, we use the detected word to perform certain tasks.



# Project Status

We managed to implement the ASR system and choose two applications for it which are Numbering System which can be easily used in numerous real-life applications such as security and dialing systems controlled by the human voice, and the Directions System which will be useful in objects movement control applications like gaming, and self-driving cars.

We implemented each application using two different neural network models(ANN, CNN) and compared between them in terms of performance and accuracy.

It was very clear that the performance of CNN model is better than ANN model.

# Reflection
What was the context for this project? (ie: was this a side project? was this for Turing? was this for an experiment?)
What did you set out to build?
Why was this project challenging and therefore a really good learning experience?
What were some unexpected obstacles?
What tools did you use to implement this project?
This might seem obvious because you are IN this codebase, but to all other humans now is the time to talk about why you chose webpack instead of create react app, or D3, or vanilla JS instead of a framework etc. Brag about your choices and justify them here.


This was a Graduation Project built during my last collage year at Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University, Communication and Electronics section.
